## Recommendations
Based on the data analyzed in the Pizza Sales Report, here are some recommendations to help increase revenue and optimize sales:

 Promote Best-Selling Pizzas

The top 5 sold pizzas, including The Thai Chicken Pizza and The Barbecue Chicken Pizza, have proven popular among customers. It‚Äôs beneficial to highlight these in promotions or meal deals. Consider bundling them with sides and drinks to boost the average order value.
Revamp or Discontinue Low-Selling Pizzas

Some pizzas, such as The Spinach Pesto Pizza and The Green Garden Pizza, are among the least popular items. These pizzas could be revamped with new ingredients or marketed to target audiences (e.g., health-conscious customers). If sales don‚Äôt improve, consider discontinuing them to focus resources on higher-selling items.
Optimize Peak Hours for Sales

The peak sales time occurs between 12 PM and 7 PM. Consider increasing staff and resources during these hours to improve efficiency and reduce wait times. Additionally, launching happy-hour deals just before the peak hours could help extend high sales periods.
Expand Large Size Options

The data indicates that large pizzas are the most popular size. To capitalize on this trend, introduce more variety in the large size or offer additional toppings and premium ingredients for large pizzas to attract more customers.
Focus on Chicken and Veggie Categories

The analysis shows that Chicken and Veggie categories are the most popular. Invest in new recipes or expand the menu with more options in these categories. These can also be highlighted in social media marketing campaigns to reach a broader audience.
Test New Flavors and Limited-Time Offers

To attract repeat customers and maintain excitement, consider introducing limited-time flavors or seasonal pizza options. Customer feedback on these new flavors can be gathered to identify potential new menu items.
Encourage Upselling for Medium and Small Sizes

Since large pizzas are highly preferred, create upselling strategies to encourage customers who purchase medium or small sizes to upgrade to a large. This could involve showing the value difference or offering discounts on larger sizes.
Run Targeted Campaigns for Underperforming Time Slots

Sales tend to decline significantly in the late evening and early morning. Offer discounts, exclusive deals, or special offers during these off-peak times to boost sales and make better use of operational hours.
